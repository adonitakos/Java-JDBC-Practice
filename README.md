# About
This is a program that is made primarily for personal practice with accessing and modifying data from a MySQL database using the Java JDBC framework and drivers.

This is not something that I can guarantee will work when git cloned/downloaded on another individual's machine (at all), but I decided to make it public anyway. However, I did export the MySQL schema to my project directory in case anyone desires to try.

Everything else was admittedly a pain to get setup. For example, I only know how to get it working within the IntelliJ IDE using a Maven Project. Even then, there were some additional challenges that were faced.
